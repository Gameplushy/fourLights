                <h2>On the Subject of Four Lights</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Binary turns them on...</p>

                <p>This module consists of four bulbs labeled from 1 to 4.</p>
                <p>Let A be a 4-digit binary number where the leftmost bulb is the most significant bit and the rightmost bulb is the least significant digit. (Lit represents a 1. Unlit represents a 0)</p>
                <p>Let B be a 4-digit binary number where the bulb labeled 1 is the most significant bit and the bulb labeled 4 is the least significant digit.</p>
                <p>Next, apply the solution technique related to the <strong>FIRST</strong> true condition. After the first press, all bulbs will turn off and all labels will disappear. Input a wrong press will make them reappear, and you will have to redo the entire sequence.</p>
                <h4>If all 4 bulbs are on :</h4>
                <p>Press the labels in ascending order.</p>
                <h4>If all 4 bulbs are off :</h4>
                <p>Press the labels in descending order.</p>
                <h4>If there are as many lit bulbs as there are lit indicators and as many unlit bulbs as there are unlit indicators on the bomb :</h4>
                <p>Press the label on position x, where x is the number of lit bulbs, and press the label y, where y is the number of unlit bulbs.</p>
                <h4>If a single bulb is lit :</h4>
                <p>Press the label whose number is the lit bulb's position.</p>
                <h4>If A and B have the same value :</h4>
                <p>Press the label of the leftmost lit bulb, then the smallest label whose bulb is lit.</p>
                <h4>If A and B, in base 10, are greater or equal to 10 (or are represented by a letter in base 16) :</h4>
                <p>Let C be (A AND B). Press the position of the labels where you have a 1, from left to right.</p>
                <p>Exemple : For A = 1010 (A in base 16) and B = 1110 (E in base 16), C=1010, meaning you have to press the 1st and 3rd label.</p>
                <h4>Otherwise :</h4>
                <p>Press the the lit bulbs' labels in ascending order, then the unlit bulbs' labels in descending order.</p>
